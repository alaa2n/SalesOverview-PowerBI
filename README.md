This dashboard tells the story of sales performance in a clear, interactive way.

It starts with the big picture: are we on track with our monthly (MTD) and yearly (YTD) targets? Instantly, you can see if sales are exceeding expectations or falling short.

From there, the story drills down into the “where” and the “what.”

Sales by Region shows which cities are driving the most revenue.

Sales by Category & Product highlights top-performing items like Bikes and Accessories.

Sales by Channel reveals how customers prefer to buy — whether through retail, wholesale, or door-to-door.

Finally, the trend line at the bottom shows how sales are evolving day by day, letting us spot peaks, dips, and seasonal behavior.

The slicers at the top act as the narrator’s lens — adjust the calendar, region, product, or channel to instantly change the story. The toggle between Value (Revenue) and Volume (Quantity) provides two different perspectives on performance, making the dashboard flexible for both finance and operations teams.

In short: this dashboard transforms raw sales data into a visual story of performance, trends, and opportunities.
